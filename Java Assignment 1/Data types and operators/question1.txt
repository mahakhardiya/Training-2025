1). Explain the difference between primitive and reference data types with examples.

A. Primitive Data Types:-
   1. Primitive types are fundamental, directly storing values.
   2. Stored in stack.
   3. It holds the actual value.
   4. It's default value is 0, false, '\u0000'.
   5. Performance wise it is faster than reference data types.
   6. Example: int a = 5;

B. Reference Data Types:-
   1. Reference types store references (memory addresses) to objects. 
   2. Stored in heap (actual object).
   3. It holds the memory address, referenceto object.
   4. Performancewise it is slower than primitive datae types due to object
   creation.
   5. Example: String str = "Hello";
